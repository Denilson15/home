# Home Page Project

This is one of the first projects I worked on when starting the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. Developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project served as an introduction to building static web pages and understanding the fundamentals of web development.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

This project showcases a simple home page layout, including:

- A header section with a navigation bar
- A main content area with text and images
- A footer section with contact information
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The HTML structure defines the layout of the page, including header, main, and footer sections.
- CSS is used to style the page, including layout, colors, and typography.
- JavaScript is included for any interactive elements or future enhancements.
- The project is structured to be easily expandable for future development.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across devices
- Structured the HTML for semantic clarity and accessibility

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add interactive elements such as a contact form or image carousel
- Implement additional pages for a multi-page website structure
- Enhance the user interface with improved styling and animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `styles.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `script.js` – JavaScript for handling interactive elements (currently minimal)
- `images/` – Folder containing image assets used in the project

## ⚙️ Getting Started
